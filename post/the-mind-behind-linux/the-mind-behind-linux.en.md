When I first learned to develop, I remember having a hard time adjusting to the strange culture of "open source". I remember when I was first introduced to this concept. In the movie industry I was working in, the way a person edited or shot a movie could become their identity.
So some people, myself included, kept these skills to themselves, not sharing them easily with others. I wouldn't say we hid them, I'd say we didn't talk about them easily.
We didn't hide it, but there was something awkward about talking about these techniques and editing. It wasn't just movie footage, but I think it was similar when I asked my friends from other majors around me. They would tell you some things, but they wouldn't tell you everything easily. There was also a much smaller "community" to get this information from. I remember that I only learned by asking my seniors.

So when I first started programming, I was surprised to see a lot of code on the internet. Many people were putting their time and effort into their code on the internet for anyone to see, and other programmers were using that code to build their own projects.
their own projects. If they see something in the code that they think could be improved, they contribute it themselves. Of course, the contributor and the original author of the code don't know each other.

How did this unusual culture come about? How did "open source" turn people from closed-minded and hiding their skills to open-minded and open-minded? There are many influences, but a big one is Linus Torvalds' Linux. Torvalds released the code for Linux, a project he had been working on for nearly a year and a half, to the Internet. Initially, he wondered if someone else would benefit from his hard work, but he didn't think twice about it and just thought, "Why not?"

This small moment was the beginning of Linux, and as people around him became interested in it, contributing ideas and code reviews, it became the largest software project in history. In the video, Torvalds said "For me, the really important moments are not when something becomes big, but when it becomes small." It seems Torvalds understood the power of small things. Linux is a big project now, but it wouldn't be where it is today without the contributions of each and every one of those early contributors.

Linux is the foundation for a huge amount of open source software around the world. Linux, mysql, git, php, swift, node.js, etc. are some examples. It is safe to say that there is no software we use today that does not use open source technologies. It's great to be able to share the perspectives of different people from around the world and see the code they've worked so hard to create for free.

The philosophy of open source continues to expand. Web encyclopedias like Wikipedia and Wikipedia were created. Encyclopedias have evolved from the idea that encyclopedias are difficult things created by experts and corporations to the idea that anyone can contribute their knowledge and others can edit it to make it more accurate. I wonder what the future of open source will be. In the video, the host asks: "Is the idea of open source fully realized in the world, or is there still a way to go?

Torvalds replies. "Open source is not just about programming, it has also influenced scientific journals and encyclopedias. I'm not a prophet and it's not up to me to say something new."
