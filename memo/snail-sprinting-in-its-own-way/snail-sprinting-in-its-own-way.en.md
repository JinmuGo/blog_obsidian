This is a playlist I've been listening to a lot lately. It makes me feel like a cool person when I'm having a hard time.
I especially like the pairing of Shujo Matsuoka's words at the beginning with Delice Peace's Chow Chow.

It's a pep talk to your own snail in a snail race, and it's unnecessarily comforting. Me, too. I can be comforted by a snail owner I've never met in the UK who's been on the news for less than three seconds.
It's a good world.

Dedicated to all snails who think they're slower than everyone else.
