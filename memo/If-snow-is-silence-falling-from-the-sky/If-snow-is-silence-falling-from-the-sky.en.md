The Han River : The Essentials ( The Hebrew Time ) / Han River / Literary Neighborhoods / 195p

Winter, snow swallowing all sound, silence, rainy season. The endlessly falling rain gives way to flowing sentences. Like water droplets that hit the ground and bounce back, our silence dreams of one day rising into sentences.  
Sentences that cross between the silence of winter and the roar of the rainy season. Fall is the season of "in-between," cleaning up the mess left by the summer rains and foreshadowing the silence of the snow to come. I share Han's phrases with you in the hope that the words that have fallen like rain will be buried among the fallen leaves and will blossom into new sentences in the silence of the first snowfall.
