a [YouTube video](https://youtu.be/cpEeqACsF_Q?si=PWDXGamHLR4c5yfD) I stumbled upon changed the course of my life.
realizing that he could communicate with the world through programming, he decided to become a programmer.

the name 撫 (nothing to touch) was created by combining 手 (hand) and 無 (nothing).
it comes from the meaning of touching the intangible things (heart, soul) with your hands to calm them down.
just like the name, I want to live my life by touching people's hearts and holding them.
