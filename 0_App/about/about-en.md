a chance [YouTube video](https://youtu.be/cpEeqACsF_Q?si=PWDXGamHLR4c5yfD) changed the course of his life. he realized that he could communicate with the world through programming and decided to become a programmer.

the name 撫 (nothing to touch) is made by combining 手 (number of hands) and 無 (nothing), which means "hand".
it comes from the meaning of stroking the shapeless things (heart, soul) with your hands to make them sink.
just like the name, I want to live my life by touching people's hearts.
