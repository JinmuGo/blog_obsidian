## I was believing every thought that came to mind.

Until now, I believed that all the thoughts in my head originated from me. But after reading this book, I realized that maybe not all the thoughts that come into my mind come from me.
And the author, Björn Natiko Lindblad, says that this was the Buddha's first gift.

> to look my consciousness in the face, and not question every thought that came into my head.
> without questioning them.

The second is to talk about the impermanence of life. I often say that life is impermanent. I used to say that life is fleeting unconsciously too, but I don't think I really meant it.
We sometimes act like we're going to live forever. Nothing lasts forever. Not even the good times, the youth, or the hard times last forever.

> Nothing lasts forever, not even the hard times.

And at the end, he says

> To gather up the attention scattered here and there and direct it where you choose.
> In the face of true pain, it's the best we can do.

So what do we gain when we don't unconditionally believe every thought that comes into our mind?
What would happen if we believed every thought that came into our minds without filtering them? This is the question that is answered in this book.

> We don't choose our thoughts. We can't control our thoughts.
> We can't control our thoughts, but we can live with some thoughts longer.
> We can give them as little space as possible.
> We can't stop thoughts from entering our minds, but we can choose to believe them or not.

## "We have the answers"

Socrates famously said. "Know thyself" I cannot yet fathom the implications of this short phrase.
I don't know myself yet. To realize this, the author goes through a process of listening to his inner self. Some call it the voice of the heart, others call it intuition.
I call it the intellect of the moment. "We have the answers," he says, and I wonder if that's what he means by listening to this momentary intelligence.

We humans have the ability to listen to our hearts.
But too many of us are unable or unwilling to listen.
The author suggests that this is because we live in an age where it's easy to find answers from the outside.
It's easy to think that happiness comes from external factors. For example, if you have a glamorous career and look like a successful person to others, you can feel pretty smug for a while.
But anyone can stop and think about it.

> that life is like living on a diet of sweet desserts.

It's beautiful to the eye and sweet to the taste, but it doesn't provide the nourishment needed to sustain life.

## That person who is bothering me is

> Most of the psychological suffering that humans experience is voluntary and self-inflicted. -p150

> Most of the suffering in our minds is not caused by external cutters, but by the constant struggle within us, that is, by the thoughts we believe or disbelieve. -p151

> I imagined that I knew what the world should be like, and when it didn't conform to my ideas, I cringed.

## Summary.

Despite my rambling, I got at least two things out of this book.

First, I learned not to believe everything that comes to mind.

It made me question whether the thoughts I'm having are really coming from me, or whether they're coming from our vague ideas and willpower.
We are still ignorant of the world. Just by questioning whether our thoughts are really coming from us, we will be able to make better choices.

Second, I realized that it's important to put aside the past and future and focus on the here and now.

The past or future can keep us alive. Fond memories with our parents, future travel plans, or success at work. We live by these things.
But after reading this book, I realized that it's important to focus on the here and now.

For example, when I went on a trip not long ago, I wanted to feel and experience a lot of things, so I planned to see a lot of things.
Where to go, what to see, where to eat, etc. But when I actually did those things, I didn't really enjoy the moment I had planned because I was thinking of other plans.
In other words, I didn't focus on what I wanted to feel and experience. Fortunately, after reading the book, I spent my trip being as conscious as possible of being in the here and now.

These two realizations or thoughts alone make this book worthwhile.

To put the past and future aside and focus on the present.

It is worthwhile just to learn to live in a state of conscious presence, that is, to be fully aware of the present.
Of course, it's not just about being in the present, but also about thinking about the past and the future.
However, as the author suggests, putting aside the past and future and focusing on the present is a way to be happier.

## Tomás Sánchez

The book I read was the Tomás Sánchez edition, which features the work of the Cuban-born painter and sculptor. He's been practicing meditation for decades, and his paintings have a similar quality to the author's.
There are 21 beautiful nature scenes in total, and reading the book alongside the paintings enriches the experience. If you want to read the book, I recommend the Tomás Sánchez edition, which combines Björn's text with Sánchez's paintings.

I can see why meditation focuses on the breath.
Our bodies live in the present by breathing, and by focusing on that survival activity, our minds are able to be present as well.
Personal value.
