This is how I felt when I was reading the book. I feel like I'm living my life with free will, but when it comes to choosing important crossroads in my life, I don't get to choose anything.

For the first time in my life, I saw the wider world, met various people, and thought seriously about my life. What do I want to do in this world and what can I do in this world. I asked myself endless questions.

I wonder how many people can answer these questions in the first place. I'm still searching for answers that I can't find.
