Summer of 2018. I was in my early twenties. I was in my early twenties, living in a rural town, and when I went to university, I was exposed to a wider world. I learned a lot of things, and it was fun to learn about the world by experiencing things firsthand that I couldn't learn in middle and high school. I think I was digesting them in a relatively short period of time, thinking it was still too early for me to learn. Along the way, I lost and regained people, gained experiences, and lost and gained again. Along the way, I thought the world was too harsh. To lose people at such a young age, to lose relationships.

At some point, I realized that something was missing from my life, that it was empty. I don't know when or where, I just went on with my life and realized it, like discovering a store on a side street that I hadn't seen in a long time. I couldn't fill it back up, because I couldn't figure out what it was. Because you didn't know what or how it got empty.

One day, as I stood there, unable to figure out why and unable to do anything about the situation, I stumbled upon Haruki's The Age of Loss in a cafe where I was trying to escape the heat in August, when the sun was shining and the grass was lush. I opened the book, mesmerized by the title, and sat down to read it for four hours. I don't know how I was able to concentrate so intently on a book that I had only read a few mystery novels before. From then on, I began to read Haruki's books one by one. I took pictures of sentences, paragraphs, etc. of books that I liked or that impressed me and saved them one by one. I even wrote down the titles. Much of it has been lost over the years, but I've kept a record of what I still have, and I'd like to reorganize it through the lens of today. This category was created to do just that. I think I needed something to aspire to at the time, and Haruki happened to be it. It's not an exaggeration to say that my early twenties consisted of Haruki. Wherever I went, I always carried one of the author's books with me, to remember the past that made me who I am today, and to convey to you the countless intense processes that I went through during those young years. I let Haruki's words and language capture a part of my life, including the feelings and times of those days.
